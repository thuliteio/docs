Your new Thulite project generated from the `create thulite` CLI wizard already includes some files and folders. Others, you will create yourself and add to Thulite' existing file structure.

Here's how a Thulite project is organized, and some files you will find in your new project.

## Directories and Files

Thulite leverages the Hugo [directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/) for your project. Every Thulite project root should include the following directories and files:

- `assets` - Your project assets (scripts, styles, images, etc.)
- `config` - Your project's configuration files (Thulite, Hugo, PostCSS, etc.)
- `content` - Your project content (pages, posts, etc.)
- `layouts` - Your project layouts (partials, shortcodes, etc.)
- `static` - Your non-code, unprocessed assets (fonts, icons, etc.)
- `package.json` - A project manifest.

## Example Project Tree

A common Thulite project directory might look like this:

<FileTree>

- assets/scss
  - common
    - _custom.scss
    - _variables-custom.scss
  - app.scss
- config
  - _default
    - hugo.toml
    - module.toml
    - params.toml
- content
  - _index.md
- layouts
  - index.html
- static
  - favicon.svg
- package.json

</FileTree>


### `assets/scss`

It is a common convention to store your CSS or Sass files in a `assets/scss` directory, but this is not required. As long as your styles live somewhere in the `assets/` directory and are imported correctly, Thulite will handle and optimize them.

The `app.scss` file is used to specify the CSS or Sass files to import (or use). Put your custom (S)CSS variables in `common/variables-custom` and custom (S)CSS code in `common/_custom.scss`.

### `config/_default/`

The `hugo.toml` file includes [Hugo configuration](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/) options for your Thulite project. Here you can specify taxonomies to use, build options, server options, and more.

The `module.toml` file specifies the [Hugo mounts](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/configuration/#module-configuration-mounts), logically linking `node_modules` directories to component folders (ex: `assets`, `layouts`) â€” making Thulite Integrations available in your Thulite project.

The `params.toml` file is where you set [Thulite configuration](/reference/configuration/) options like e.g. options for themes and integrations. 

### `content/`

The `content/` directory is where you store [pages](/basics/pages/), organized in sections or page bundles (leaf bundles or branch bundles) and can contain page resources.

### `layouts/`

[Layouts](/basics/layouts/) are Thulite templates that define the UI structure shared by one or more pages.

### `static/`

The `static/` directory is for files and assets that do not need to be processed during Hugo's build process. The files in this folder will be copied into the build folder untouched, and then your site will be built.

This behavior makes `static/` ideal for common assets  that do not require any processing, like some images and fonts, or special files such as `robots.txt` and `manifest.webmanifest`.

You can place CSS and JavaScript in your `static/` directory, but be aware that those files will not be bundled or optimized in your final build.

:::tip
As a general rule, any CSS or JavaScript that you write yourself should live in your `assets/` directory.

### `package.json`

This is a file used by JavaScript package managers to manage your dependencies. It also defines the scripts that are commonly used to run Thulite (ex: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`).

There are [two kinds of dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file) you can specify in a `package.json`: `dependencies` and `devDependencies`. In most cases, these work the same: Thulite needs all dependencies at build time, and your package manager will install both. We recommend putting all of your dependencies in `dependencies` to start, and only use `devDependencies` if you find a specific need to do so.
