Once you have a Thulite project, now you're ready to build with Thulite! ðŸš€

## Edit your project

To make changes to your project, open your project folder in your code editor. Working in development mode with the dev server running allows you to see updates to your site as you edit the code.

You can also customize aspects of your development environment such as configuring TypeScript or installing the official Astro editor extensions.

### Start the Hugo dev server

Thulite utilizes the Hugo development server that has everything you need for project development. The `hugo server` CLI command will start the local development server so that you can see your new website in action for the very first time.

Every starter template comes with a pre-configured script that will run `hugo server` for you. After navigating into your project directory, use your favorite package manager to run this command and start the Hugo development server.

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
npm run dev
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm dev
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
yarn dev
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
```bash
bun dev
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If all goes well, Thulite should now be serving your project on [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/). Visit that link in your browser and see your new site!

### Work in development mode

Hugo will listen for live file changes in your project directory and update your site preview as you build, so you will not need to restart the server as you make changes during development. You will always be able to see an up-to-date version of your site in your browser when the dev server is running.

If you aren't able to open your project in the browser after starting the dev server, go back to the terminal where you ran the `dev` command and check the message displayed. It should tell you if an error occurred, or if your project is being served at a different URL than [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/).

## Build and preview your site

To check the version of your site that will be created at build time, quit the dev server (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>) and run the appropriate build command for your package manager in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
npm run build
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm build
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
yarn run build
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
```bash
bun run build
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Hugo will build a deploy-ready version of your site in a separate folder (`public/` by default) and you can watch its progress in the terminal. This will alert you to any build errors in your project before you deploy to production.

When the build is finished, run the appropriate `preview` command (e.g. `npm run preview`) in your terminal and you can view the built version of your site locally in the same browser preview window.

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
npm run preview
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm preview
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
yarn run preview
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
```bash
bun run preview
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that this previews your code as it existed when the build command was last run. This is meant to give you a preview of how your site will look when it is deployed to the web. Any later changes you make to your code after building will **not** be reflected while you preview your site until you run the build command again.

Use (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>) to quit the preview and run another terminal command, such as restarting the dev server to go back to [working in development mode](#work-in-development-mode) which does update as you edit to show a live preview of your code changes.

:::tip
You may wish to [deploy your new site right away](/guides/deploy/overview/), before you begin to add or change too much code. This is helpful to get a minimal, working version of your site published and can save you extra time and effort troubleshooting your deployment later.
