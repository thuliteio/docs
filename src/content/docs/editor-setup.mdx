Customize your code editor to improve the Thulite developer experience and unlock new features.

## VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular code editor for web developers, built by Microsoft. The VS Code engine also powers popular in-browser code editors like [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/).

Thulite works with any code editor. However, VS Code is our recommended editor for Thulite projects together with the following extensions:

- [Hugo Language and Syntax Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=budparr.language-hugo-vscode)
- [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
- [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
- [Stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint)

## In-Browser Editors

In addition to local editors, Thulite also runs well on in-browser hosted editors, including:

- [GitHub.dev](https://github.dev/) — available to everyone for free on GitHub.com.
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) — isolated cloud development environments with your favorite editor.
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) — 24/7 collaborative cloud development environments (CDEs) that resume in 2 seconds.

### Not yet supported

- [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/) — write, run, and debug frontend code directly in your browser.

## Other tools

### Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is a popular formatter for JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more. Thulite includes Prettier and a `format` command that runs `prettier **/** -w -c`. You can customize the Thulite defaults for Prettier by updating the `.prettierrc.yaml` and `.prettierignore` files in your project root.
