[Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting) is a service provided by Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) app development platform, which can be used to deploy a Thulite site. 

## Prerequisites

## How to deploy

1. Create `firebase.json` at the root of your project with the following content:

   ```json title="firebase.json"
   {
     "hosting": {
       "public": "public",
       "ignore": []
     }
   }
   ```

2. Create `.firebaserc` at the root of your project with the following content:

   ```json title= ".firebaserc"
   {
     "projects": {
       "default": "<YOUR_FIREBASE_ID>"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run your build command:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="pnpm">

    pnpm run build
    ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Yarn">
