You can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host a Thulite website directly from a repository on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).

## How to deploy

You can deploy a Thulite site to GitHub Pages by using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically build and deploy your site. To do this, your source code must be hosted on GitHub.

Follow the instructions below to deploy your Thulite site to GitHub pages.

1. Create a new file in your project at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and paste in the YAML below.

    ```yaml title="deploy.yml"
    # Sample workflow for building and deploying a Thulite site to GitHub Pages
    name: Deploy Thulite site to Pages

    on:
      # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
      push:
        branches:
          - main

      # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
      workflow_dispatch:

    # Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write

    # Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
    # However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
    concurrency:
      group: "pages"
      cancel-in-progress: false

    # Default to bash
    defaults:
      run:
        shell: bash

    jobs:
      # Build job
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
          HUGO_VERSION: 0.126.0
        steps:
          - name: Install Hugo CLI
            run: |
              wget -O ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb \
              && sudo dpkg -i ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb
          - name: Install Dart Sass
            run: sudo snap install dart-sass
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v4
            with:
              submodules: recursive
              fetch-depth: 0
          - name: Setup Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v4
            with:
              node-version: '20'
              cache: 'npm'
          - name: Setup Pages
            id: pages
            uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: "[[ -f package-lock.json || -f npm-shrinkwrap.json ]] && npm ci || true"
          - name: Build production website
            env:
              # For maximum backward compatibility with Hugo modules
              HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production
              HUGO_ENV: production
              TZ: America/Los_Angeles
            run: |
              npm run build \
                -- \
                --baseURL "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/"
          - name: Upload artifact
            uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
            with:
              path: ./public

      # Deployment job
      deploy:
        environment:
          name: github-pages
          url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        needs: build
        steps:
          - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
            id: deployment
            uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4

    ```

2. On GitHub, go to your repository's **Settings** tab and find the **Pages** section of the settings.

3. Choose **GitHub Actions** as the **Source** of your site.

4. Commit the new workflow file and push it to GitHub.

5. Copy the **Your site is published at** URL and paste it as `baseurl` in `./config/production/hugo.toml`.

7. Push the changes to GitHub and wait for the action to finish succesfully (after approximately 30 seconds).

That's it. After a minute or so, you site is avaliable at the **Your site is published at** URL. When you push changes to your Thulite project's repository, the GitHub Action will automatically deploy them for you.

:::tip[Set up a custom domain]
You can optionally set up a custom domain by adding the following `./public/CNAME` file to your project: 

```js title="public/CNAME"
sub.mydomain.com
```

This will deploy your site at your custom domain instead of `user.github.io`. Don't forget to also [configure DNS for your domain provider](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain).
