[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) is a cloud platform from Microsoft. You can deploy your Thulite site with Microsoft Azure's [Static Web Apps](https://aka.ms/staticwebapps) service.

:::tip[Looking for an example?]
Check out the [official Microsoft Azure Doks example project](https://github.com/thuliteio/doks-microsoft-azure)!
:::

This guide takes you through deploying your Thulite site stored in GitHub using Visual Studio Code. Please see Microsoft guides for using an [Azure Pipelines Task](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-static-web-app-v0?view=azure-pipelines) for other setups.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you will need:

- An Azure account and a subscription key. You can create a [free Azure account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- Your app code pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- The [SWA Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## How to deploy

1. Open your project in VS Code.

2. Open the Static Web Apps extension, sign in to Azure, and click the **+** button to create a new Static Web App. You will be prompted to designate which subscription key to use.

3. Follow the wizard started by the extension to give your app a name, choose a framework preset, and designate the app root (usually `/`) and built file location (use `/public`). Thulite is not listed in the built-in templates in Azure so you will need to select `custom`. The wizard will run and will create a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) in the `.github` folder of your repo. (This folder will be automatically created if it does not already exist.) 

The GitHub Action will deploy your app (you can see its progress in your repo's Actions tab on GitHub). When successfully completed, you can view your app at the address shown in the SWA Extension's progress window by clicking the **Browse Website** button (this will appear after the GitHub Action has run).

## Known Issues

The build fails because an old (no longer supported) Node version and/or Hugo version is used.

### Node version

To resolve this, update your projects `package.json` file with this snippet:

```json
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=20.11.0"
  },
```

### Hugo version

To resolve this, update your workflow file by providing a value for `HUGO_VERSION` in the `env` section:

```yaml
jobs:
  build_and_deploy_job:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' || (github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action != 'closed')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Build and Deploy Job
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          submodules: true
          lfs: false
      - name: Build And Deploy
        id: builddeploy
        uses: Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure_static_web_apps_api_token: ${{ secrets.AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_NICE_BUSH_0D736421E }}
          repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Used for Github integrations (i.e. PR comments)
          action: "upload"
          ###### Repository/Build Configurations - These values can be configured to match your app requirements. ######
          # For more information regarding Static Web App workflow configurations, please visit: https://aka.ms/swaworkflowconfig
          app_location: "/" # App source code path
          api_location: "api" # Api source code path - optional
          output_location: "public" # Built app content directory - optional
          ###### End of Repository/Build Configurations ######
        env:
          HUGO_VERSION: 0.131.0
