[Netlify](https://netlify.com) offers hosting and serverless backend services for web applications and static websites. Any Thulite site can be hosted on Netlify!

This guide includes instructions for deploying to Netlify through the website UI or Netlify's CLI.

## How to deploy

You can deploy to Netlify through the website UI or using Netlify's CLI (command line interface).

### Website UI Deployment

If your project is stored in GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or Azure DevOps, you can use the Netlify website UI to deploy your Thulite site.

1. Click <kbd>Add a new site</kbd> in your [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)

2. Choose <kbd>Import an existing project</kbd>

    When you import your Thulite repository from your Git provider, Netlify should automatically detect and pre-fill the correct configuration settings for you.

3. Make sure that the following settings are entered, then press the <kbd>Deploy</kbd> button:

    - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
    - **Publish directory:** `public`

 After deploying, you will be redirected to the site overview page. There, you can edit the details of your site.

Any future changes to your source repository will trigger preview and production deploys based on your deployment configuration.

#### `netlify.toml` file

You can optionally create a new `netlify.toml` file at the top level of your project repository to configure your build command and publish directory, as well as other project settings including environment variables and redirects. Netlify will read this file and automatically configure your deployment.

To configure the default settings, create a `netlify.toml` file with the following contents:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "public"
```

### CLI Deployment

You can also create a new site on Netlify and link up your Git repository by installing and using the [Netlify CLI](https://cli.netlify.com/).


1. Install Netlify's CLI globally

    ```bash
    npm install --global netlify-cli
    ```

2. Run `netlify login` and follow the instructions to log in and authorize Netlify
3. Run `netlify init` and follow the instructions
4. Confirm your build command (`npm run build`)

    The CLI will automatically detect the build settings (`npm run build`) and deploy directory (`public`), and will offer to automatically generate a [`netlify.toml` file](#netlifytoml-file) with those settings.

5. Build and deploy by pushing to Git

    The CLI will add a deploy key to the repository, which means your site will be automatically rebuilt on Netlify every time you `git push`.

### Set a Node.js Version

If you are using a legacy [build image](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/#build-image-selection) (Xenial) on Netlify, make sure that your Node.js version is set. Thulite requires `v18.14.1` or higher.

You can [specify your Node.js version in Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript) using:
- a [`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#nvmrc) file in your base directory.
- a `NODE_VERSION` environment variable in your site's settings using the Netlify project dashboard.
- a `NODE_VERSION` environment variable in your site's `netlify.toml`, for example:

    ```toml
    [build.environment]
      NODE_VERSION = "20.10.0"
      NPM_VERSION = "10.2.3"
    ```

## Using Netlify Functions

No special configuration is required to use Netlify Functions with Thulite. Add a `netlify/functions` directory to your project root and follow [the Netlify Functions documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) to get started!
