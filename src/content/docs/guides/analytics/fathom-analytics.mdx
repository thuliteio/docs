[Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/) is a Google Analytics alternative that doesn't compromise visitor privacy for data.

## Set up Fathom

To follow this guide, you'll need an existing [Thulite](https://thulite.io/) site and a [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/docs/start/create) project.

### Add script

Add to `layouts/partials/head/script-header.html`:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.usefathom.com/script.js" data-site="SITE_ID" defer></script>
```
