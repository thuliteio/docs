[Thulite](https://thulite.io/) is a web framework designed for speed, security, and SEO — all powered by Hugo and npm. Here you'll find guides, resources, and references to help you build with Thulite.

## Quick Start

Get a new Thulite project up and running locally with our helpful `create-thulite` CLI wizard!

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="npm">
```bash
npm create thulite@latest
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm create thulite@latest
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```bash
yarn create thulite
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
```bash
bun create thulite@latest
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Our [Installation Guide](/install-and-setup/) has step-by-step instructions for installing Thulite using our CLI wizard, creating a new project from an existing Thulite GitHub repository, and for installing Thulite manually.
